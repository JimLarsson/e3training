# Contributing

Improvements to this training series are appreciated, especially if you notice commands being incorrect or out-of-date. Ensure that you try the steps on a fairly blank machine, having performed all the earlier steps of the tutorial, prior to making the change.

Changes shall as usual be done in a separate branch, after which a Pull Request can be made.

If you want advice on intended changes, contact one of the earlier contributors.

Make sure to look at the [DO-NOT-README.md](workbook/DO-NOT-README.md) prior to starting your work.
