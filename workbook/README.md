# European Spallation Source EPICS Environment Workbook

This workbook is intended to introduce new users to ESS' EPICS environment e3. As it's focused on specifically e3, it will not contain much information about EPICS standard functionality. Also note that this workbook is intended for e3 app developers and integrators; if you simply want to use EPICS to read or manipulate PVs you can either run the first two installation commands, or e.g. install EPICS base using conda from conda-forge.

As this workbook still is under construction, many chapters remain unfinished. Chapters marked with the icon :construction: are still being worked on.

For some of the chapters there are supplementary directories containing code, so it's recommended to clone this repository.
