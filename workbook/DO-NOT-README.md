This file is only meant to outline the structure of this repo, and to host some information prior to rework of this learning series.

# Standard template for lessons

For coding standards see any of the early chapters. Keep it clean and tidy, and see how different elements (e.g. `> Some text.`) have been used previously.

Each lesson should start with a "Return to ToC", then an overview, and should end with a horizontal rule (`---`) and then a link to the next chapter as well as a "Return to ToC".

Open code blocks should have language definitions for highlighting to whatever degree possible; when the language isn't available (GitHub markdown is quite limited), use whatever works.

# To-Do

[ ] Clean up all existing chapters
[ ] Do the full tutorial to ensure all steps work
[ ] Clean up all complementary material
[x] Outline what had been thought-up by Han previously for future chapters
[ ] Balance the chapters better
[ ] Think of a logical separation for parts 1 and 2 or remove separation; best option currently seems to be 1) e3 core, 2) e3 advanced and ESS-tools

## Loose notes

- Add info about where repos get cloned by default, suggest how to better organise them
- Chapter on Best practises
- There should probably be a contact listed for questions
- Link to more external things; autosave, css phoebus, git submodules, etc.
- Talk about the e3 wrapper
- Possibly create separate mini-lessons for e3 users (non-devs)
- Add glossary

# LEGACY

Below is some information on code and notes left by Han.

## 9.md

Seems like an early version of the dependency chapter. Slightly different approach so might be worth having a look.
